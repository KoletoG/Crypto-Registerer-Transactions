# Solana blockchain transaction registerer

Application useful for marketing of a solana blockchain cryptocurrency (mostly memecoins).
User adds how much memecoins has he donated to some wallets in order to speed up populating the memecoin.
The application writes the wallets and their sum to wallets.txt in user's main folder.
You register the donations (wallet of the other user and the sum of coins you have sent them) in the app so you keep better track of which user have already received coins.
Simple application.
